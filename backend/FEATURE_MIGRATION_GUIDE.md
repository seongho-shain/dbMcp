# Feature-Based Architecture Migration Guide

## Overview
The backend has been successfully reorganized from a controller-based MVC structure to a feature-based modular architecture. Each feature now contains its own complete module with routes, services, and models.

## New Architecture Structure

```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── features/                    # Feature-based modules
│   │   ├── auth/                    # Authentication feature
│   │   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   │   ├── models.py           # Auth-specific models
│   │   │   ├── service.py          # Auth business logic
│   │   │   └── routes.py           # Auth API endpoints
│   │   ├── teacher/                 # Teacher feature
│   │   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   │   ├── models.py           # Teacher-specific models
│   │   │   ├── service.py          # Teacher business logic
│   │   │   └── routes.py           # Teacher API endpoints
│   │   ├── student/                 # Student feature
│   │   ├── chat/                    # Chat feature
│   │   ├── gallery/                 # Gallery feature
│   │   └── image_generation/        # Image generation feature
│   ├── core/                        # Shared core services
│   │   ├── config/                  # Configuration
│   │   ├── models/                  # Shared models
│   │   ├── services/                # Shared services
│   │   └── utils/                   # Shared utilities
│   ├── controllers/                 # DEPRECATED - Will be removed
│   └── views/                       # DEPRECATED - Will be removed
└── main.py                          # Updated to use feature routing
```

## API Endpoint Changes

### Authentication Endpoints
- **OLD**: `/teacher/signup`, `/teacher/login`, `/student/login`
- **NEW**: `/auth/teacher/signup`, `/auth/teacher/login`, `/auth/student/login`

### Teacher Endpoints
- **OLD**: `/teacher/create-class`, `/teacher/{teacher_id}/sessions`
- **NEW**: `/teacher/create-class`, `/teacher/{teacher_id}/sessions`

### Student Endpoints
- **OLD**: `/student/session/{session_id}/students`
- **NEW**: `/student/session/{session_id}/students`

### Chat Endpoints
- **OLD**: `/chat/ai`, `/chat/ai/stream`, `/chat/history/{user_id}/{session_id}`
- **NEW**: `/chat/ai`, `/chat/ai/stream`, `/chat/history/{user_id}/{session_id}`

### Gallery Endpoints
- **OLD**: `/api/gallery/*`
- **NEW**: `/gallery/*` (with backward compatibility at `/api/gallery/*`)

### Image Generation Endpoints
- **OLD**: `/api/image/*`
- **NEW**: `/image/*` (with backward compatibility at `/api/image/*`)

## Migration Benefits

### 1. Improved Code Organization
- Each feature is self-contained with its own models, services, and routes
- Easier to locate and modify feature-specific code
- Reduced file coupling between different features

### 2. Enhanced Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Single responsibility principle applied at the feature level
- Easier to test individual features

### 3. Better Scalability
- New features can be added without affecting existing code
- Features can be developed independently
- Easy to remove or replace features

### 4. Improved Developer Experience
- More intuitive code structure
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Clear boundaries between different functionalities

## Import Path Changes

### For External Imports (Frontend, Tests, etc.)
Most API endpoints remain the same, but authentication endpoints have moved:

```python
# OLD
POST /teacher/signup
POST /teacher/login
POST /student/login

# NEW
POST /auth/teacher/signup
POST /auth/teacher/login
POST /auth/student/login
```

### For Internal Imports (Backend Code)
If you need to import from the new feature modules:

```python
# Auth feature
from app.features.auth.models import TeacherSignupRequest, LoginResponse
from app.features.auth.service import AuthService

# Teacher feature
from app.features.teacher.models import CreateClassRequest
from app.features.teacher.service import TeacherService

# Student feature
from app.features.student.service import StudentService

# Chat feature
from app.features.chat.models import ChatRequest, ChatResponse
from app.features.chat.service import ChatService

# Gallery feature
from app.features.gallery.models import GalleryItemCreate
from app.features.gallery.service import GalleryService

# Image Generation feature
from app.features.image_generation.models import CoreImageRequest
from app.features.image_generation.service import ImageGenerationService
```

## Backward Compatibility

The new architecture maintains backward compatibility for:
- Gallery endpoints (`/api/gallery/*`)
- Image generation endpoints (`/api/image/*`)
- All existing core functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Verify all endpoints work correctly with the new structure
2. **Documentation**: Update API documentation to reflect new endpoints
3. **Frontend Updates**: Update frontend code to use new auth endpoints
4. **Cleanup**: Remove deprecated controller and view files after confirming everything works
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor for any issues during the transition period

## Feature Module Template

For adding new features, follow this template:

```
new_feature/
├── __init__.py              # Feature module initialization
├── models.py                # Pydantic models for requests/responses
├── service.py               # Business logic and database operations
└── routes.py                # FastAPI routes and endpoint definitions
```

## Database and Core Services

All features continue to use the same:
- `DatabaseService` for database operations
- Shared configuration from `app.core.config`
- Shared utilities from `app.core.utils`
- Shared models from `app.core.models` (for common schemas)

This ensures consistency while maintaining the benefits of the feature-based architecture.
